This is a README file for the 0x0A. Python - Inheritance project
This project has the following tasks to accomplish;
1. Write a function that returns the list of available attributes and methods of an object:
2. Write a class MyList that inherits from list:
3. Write a function that returns True if the object is exactly an instance of the specified class 
4. Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of, 
5. Write a function that returns True if the object is an instance of a class that inherited (directly or indirectly) from the specified class ;
6. Write an empty class BaseGeometry.
7. Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 5-base_geometry.py).
8. Write a class BaseGeometry (based on 6-base_geometry.py).
9. write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py).
10. Write a class Rectangle that inherits from BaseGeometry (7-base_geometry.py). (task based on 8-rectangle.py)
11. Write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py)
12. Write a class Square that inherits from Rectangle (9-rectangle.py). (task based on 10-square.py).
13. Write a class MyInt that inherits from int:
14. Write a function that adds a new attribute to an object if itâ€™s possible:
