This is a README file for project 0x03. Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples
This project has the following task
1. Write a function that prints all integers of a list.
2. Write a function that retrieves an element from a list like in C.
3. Write a function that replaces an element of a list at a specific position (like in C).
4. Write a function that prints all integers of a list, in reverse order.
5. Write a function that replaces an element in a list at a specific position without modifying the original list (like in C).
6. Write a function that removes all characters c and C from a string.
7. Write a function that prints a matrix of integers.
8. Write a function that adds 2 tuples.
9. Write a function that returns a tuple with the length of a string and its first character.
10. Write a function that finds the biggest integer of a list.
11. Write a function that finds all multiples of 2 in a list.
12. Write a function that deletes the item at a specific position in a list.
13. Complete the source code in order to switch value of a and b
14. Write a function in C that checks if a singly linked list is a palindrome.
