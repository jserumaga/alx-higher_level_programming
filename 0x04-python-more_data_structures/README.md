This is a README file for the project 0x04-python-more_data_structures
It has the foloowing tasks;
1. Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix.
2. Write a function that replaces all occurrences of an element by another in a new list.
3. Write a function that adds all unique integers in a list (only once for each integer).
4. Write a function that returns a set of common elements in two sets.
5. Write a function that returns a set of all elements present in only one set.
6. Write a function that returns the number of keys in a dictionary.
7. Write a function that prints a dictionary by ordered keys.
8. Write a function that replaces or adds key/value in a dictionary.
9. Write a function that deletes a key in a dictionary.
10. Write a function that returns a new dictionary with all values multiplied by 2
11. Write a function that returns a key with the biggest integer value.
12. Write a function that returns a list with all values multiplied by a number without using any loops.
13. Create a function def roman_to_int(roman_string): that converts a Roman numeral to an integer.
14. Write a function that returns the weighted average of all integers tuple (<score>, <weight>)
15. Write a function that computes the square value of all integers of a matrix using map
16. Write a function that deletes keys with a specific value in a dictionary.
17. Create two C functions that print some basic info about Python lists and Python bytes objects.
